# BridgeTrace-AI — Live Demo

This page contains an interactive demo of the BridgeTrace-AI system.

The goal is to demonstrate how AI and graph intelligence can be used to
trace financial flows between traditional banking systems and blockchain
networks, highlighting risk signals and anomalous patterns.

This demo is a simulation focused on concept validation and UX, not a
production backend.
